`My Superpower - Your code starts working when you show me the problem and I merely stare at it!`

I’m a CS grad at the University of Florida. Big believer in hard work and a passionate software engineer with 3 years of professional experience. At Deloitte, I began my journey as an SDE Intern, focusing on enhancing user experience through various frontend technologies. As I transitioned to the role of a Software Engineer, I learned the importance of developing reusable components and integrating frontend with backend systems for efficient data interaction. This role provided me with valuable insights into the intricacies of software development processes and the significance of collaboration within a team. Upon being promoted to Senior Software Engineer, I not only honed my technical skills but also embraced leadership responsibilities, mentoring junior team members and guiding architectural decisions. Working on projects involving Docker and Kubernetes, I gained hands-on experience in containerization and orchestration, understanding their impact on system scalability and deployment efficiency. Throughout my tenure, I realized the critical role of performance optimization in delivering high-quality software solutions, which prompted me to focus on improving rendering speed and reducing application load time. Overall, my journey at Deloitte was characterized by continuous learning, growth, and the cultivation of both technical and leadership skills.

During my tenure as a Research Assistant at California State University Long Beach, I conducted in-depth research focusing on dynamic visualizations for enhanced decision-making in power systems monitoring by utilizing conformal prediction framework. Leveraging Angular and D3.js, I explored methods to create visually compelling representations of complex data, aiming to improve situational awareness and decision support. This experience not only allowed me to deepen my technical expertise in web development and data visualization but also provided valuable insights into the practical application of these technologies in research-driven environments.

I have also done several projects in deep learning, Generative AI and various full stack projects uitilizing frameworks like React, Angular and Flask.
